            ðŸŽ‰ Congratulationsâ€”youâ€™ve found the corner of the internet where existential crises meet bad career decisions. Before you dive into this story, letâ€™s set the stage:
          </p>
          <p className="text-center leading-relaxed">
            This is the tale of **Dave**â€”a highly intelligent, deeply unsuccessful developer who has spent his 30s debugging his life with **negative results**. Heâ€™s sarcastic, self-deprecating, and possibly one bad Sprint Planning meeting away from a full-blown mental breakdown.
          </p>
          <p className="text-center leading-relaxed">
            But donâ€™t worryâ€”this isnâ€™t a tragedy. Itâ€™s a **comedy**. The kind that hits way too close to home for anyone who has ever stared at an endless loop of failure and thought, *"Surely this is someone elseâ€™s fault."*
          </p>
          <p className="text-center font-semibold text-indigo-300">
            So, grab a coffee, settle in, and prepare for a story filled with bad decisions, corporate nightmares, and the faint hope that maybe, just maybe, thereâ€™s a way out.
          </p>
