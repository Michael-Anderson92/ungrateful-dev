            Chapter Two: The Corporate Trap
I wake up to the sound of my phone vibrating aggressively against my nightstand—a violent reminder that, despite my best efforts, I am still employed. Technically. Kind of.
The notification on my screen is an email from some HR department with the subject line:
“Exciting Opportunity for Developers!”
My first instinct is to delete it out of principle. But I hesitate. My fridge currently contains a single ketchup packet, and my bank account has entered a "fun new phase" where it shows me an estimated negative balance.
Fine. I’ll read it.
It turns out that some soul-crushing corporate entity is looking for a developer to join their “dynamic team.” That phrase alone sends a chill down my spine. Dynamic team? Translation: A group of people who pretend to enjoy Agile meetings while slowly dying inside.
The pay isn’t great, but it’s pay—an upgrade from my current economic status of “exposure and disappointment.” Against my better judgment, I apply.
A few days later, I get the dreaded confirmation: “We’re thrilled to welcome you aboard!”
No, they are not thrilled. Nobody in HR has ever been thrilled about anything except maybe leaving work early on Fridays.
I arrive on my first day dressed in my best attempt at corporate camouflage—a button-down that still has creases from when I bought it two years ago for a wedding I never attended. The office is a fluorescent-lit dystopia, complete with ergonomic chairs and motivational posters that say things like “CODE YOUR FUTURE.”
I meet my new team. They are… fine. Average. The kind of people who discuss JavaScript frameworks with too much enthusiasm. My manager greets me with a smile so forced it might physically hurt him.
Then the real horror begins.
“Alright, Dave, we’re going to get you set up with some training materials on our internal software.”
I click the link.
I stare in horror.
It is the worst software I have ever seen.
No documentation. Unintuitive UI. The source code is a tangled mess that hasn’t been updated since the Obama administration.
I break out in a cold sweat.
This is my life now.
I take a sip of coffee that tastes like regret and think: I might not survive this.
