            <br></br><br></br>Software Engineer, Digital Artist, and all-around Nerd. That pretty much sums me up. 
            
            A typical work day for me consists of waking up, drinking the morning brew, and dreaming big. 
            
            I'm unashamedly grateful to God for blessing me with my two beautiful boys, and the ability to do what I love. 
            
            I'm also overly humorous, and I frankly don't care. <span></span>Sue me!<br></br><br></br>

            I'm early in my journey as a developer, but I've adapted a <span className="text-green-500">growth mindset</span>, and I'm committed to learning, improving, and building things that help others and myself. 
            
            Whether it's solving a tricky bug or shipping a new feature, I find real joy in the process and the progress.

            When I'm not writing code, you'll probably find me building LEGO contraptions with my kids, coaching baseball, or enjoying time with my family.

            I keep things pretty simple, but I really believe you can make a difference from your own home if you stick with it. I appreciate every bit of support and encouragement along the way.

            Yours truly,
            Michael Anderson
