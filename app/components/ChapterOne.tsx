            Chapter One: Personal Patch Notes
            
            Welcome to my personal beta release, also known as my life, which is currently riddled with unresolved bugs and crashing unpredictably. You’re here now, so I might as well onboard you properly.
Let’s start with the basics. My name is Dave, and I was supposed to be a genius. I had dreams—big ones. The kind that make venture capitalists salivate and tech bloggers write pretentious think pieces about my “disruptive vision.” Instead, I’m thirty-two, my fridge contains a single ketchup packet and despair, and I’m currently debating whether spending three hours perfecting my LinkedIn profile counts as real work. Spoiler: It does not.
I am what you might call a developer, except my career path looks more like spaghetti code than a well-structured architecture. I can write clean, elegant software, but I cannot, for the life of me, debug my existence. If this were a simulation, I’d assume I was spawned into the world with poorly optimized parameters. Maybe an accidental extra line of if (success == true) {return false;}
The universe has not been kind. My so-called peers—those traitors—are thriving. They’re getting promotions, launching startups, tweeting about their six-figure salaries like it’s a normal Tuesday. Meanwhile, I’m still wondering why my bank account balance looks like a poorly funded open-source project.
Freelancing? Oh, yeah, I do some work. If you define “work” as getting paid in exposure and disappointment. Every client I’ve ever had has ghosted me harder than my dating history. I’m pretty sure one guy still owes me money from a project he abandoned during his "spiritual awakening", which—fun fact—was just a midlife crisis rebranded with better aesthetics.
Right now, I’m staring at my monitor, a battlefield of unfinished projects, dead repositories, and broken dreams. I take a sip of coffee, which tastes suspiciously like regret. The loop continues.
