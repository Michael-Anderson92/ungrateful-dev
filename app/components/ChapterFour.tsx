            Chapter Four: The Last Commit
It happens at exactly 3:47 PM on a Wednesday—because of course it’s a Wednesday. That’s when clarity strikes.
I am staring at the same broken microservices transition plan, the one that leadership insists will “revolutionize our efficiency” but will more realistically lead to a decade of catastrophic outages.
Something in me shifts. A realization, pure and undeniable:
I do not belong here.
I am not built for corporate survival. I am not meant to spend my days optimizing server responses for an app that nobody actually enjoys using. I was meant for something more—or at the very least, something less soul-crushing.
So, I make a decision.
I stand up (yes, physically—this is rare). I walk over to my manager’s desk (also rare). And I deliver my resignation like a perfectly executed exception handling statement:
“Hey, I’m gonna go ahead and return null on this job.”
Silence.
My manager blinks twice, possibly rebooting.
“You’re… quitting?”
“Yes.”
“Effective when?”
I shrug. “Right now. Or retroactively, if that’s an option.”
I walk out before the system can throw an error.
Escape plan? Oh, yeah, I’ve got one. It’s risky, ill-advised, and probably a terrible decision, but I have one last idea.
I’m going all-in on my own project.
The startup idea I abandoned years ago—the one every investor ignored, the one I convinced myself was impossible? I’m reviving it. I’m building something I believe in, even if it fails spectacularly.
I take a sip of coffee, no longer filled with despair.
This is the fresh start. This is the last commit. This is the only way forward.
