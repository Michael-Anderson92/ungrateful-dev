            Chapter Three: The Stand-Up of Doom
I wake up with the same thought I’ve had every morning since accepting this job: Did I accidentally sell my soul, or was it just leased with an option to buy?
At precisely 9:01 AM, I receive my first calendar invite of the day: "Daily Stand-Up"—a meeting designed to drain the soul from any remaining optimists.
Here’s how a stand-up works: Every developer, one by one, announces what they worked on yesterday, what they’re doing today, and what pointless obstacle is preventing them from making progress.
It is a ceremonial display of suffering.
I join the call. My video is off, naturally. Never let them see the deadness in your eyes.
“Alright, Dave, what do you have for us today?” my manager asks, his voice filled with the strained enthusiasm of a man who regrets his life choices.
I stare at my notes.
What did I do yesterday? I recall spending six hours trying to decipher a 12-year-old codebase written by an unknown developer who, judging by their work, either hated humanity or was actively trying to sabotage the company.
“Uh… I spent the day trying to understand our internal API,” I say.
Everyone nods knowingly. They have all fought this monster before. None have won.
“Great,” my manager lies.
The next developer speaks, explaining how they spent three days fixing one bug that somehow broke everything else.
This is the way of things.
Finally, after everyone has reported their slow descent into madness, my manager drops a bombshell:
“So, leadership wants us to transition all our legacy code… to microservices.”
There is silence.
You see, Dave knows what microservices are. He knows they are supposed to be modern, scalable, and efficient. But he also knows that in every company, microservices are actually the beginning of chaos.
It is the equivalent of taking a stable, albeit frustrating, system and replacing it with five hundred tiny, interdependent failures.
My coworker speaks first.
“Is… is leadership aware of how much work that entails?”
My manager sighs in a way that suggests leadership is aware, but does not care.
The meeting ends with vague promises that “it will be fine.”
It will not be fine.
I take a sip of coffee, now cold, now lifeless—just like me.
